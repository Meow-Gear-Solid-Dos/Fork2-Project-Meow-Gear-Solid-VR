Desired Modification
- Re-design map
- Change the point of view of camera (change to first person) so that can look around?!
- X-ray vision (later) 
- Modify the AI (the purpose of AI: the AI agents (aka the enemies) follow a path. If enemies see the player, chase the player.
If the enemies/AI agents do not see the players for 15 seconds, they will return to their path. 
Set enemies "way point" / Automate the enemies walking around. 
- Re-code "Cone" sidelines of the enemies (aka how far and how wide enemies can see) (make the light radiant)
(want to check if there is more efficient way to it-- code cleaning) 
- Sound lures (attract the enemies to you)/ Grab objects and throw them away to distract the enemies and shoot from behind
- Figure out inventory system (maybe use an array list)
